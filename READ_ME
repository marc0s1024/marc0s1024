This branch contains some of my MATLAB projects!

*SOPHOMORE YEAR*

=== Final_Project_Group_15 ===
This project is one I led where my group had to explore representing a dynamical system in MATLAB.
The final project expanded on previous labs we completed by accounting for disturbances in the linear dynamic system.
A report explaining each MATLAB function is included and the live script file automatically runs all functions with randomized inputs!

*FRESHMAN YEAR*

=== EDD_112_2022_LPE_Review_HW ===
This is my freshman year final exam review with various MATLAB projects and a Simio project thrown in.
