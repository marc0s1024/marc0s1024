This branch contains two projects I worked on using the Pololu Zumo 32U4 OLED!
*main.c files contain driving functions for both projects*

=== Project1v2 ===
This C program allows for the Pololu Zumo 32U4 to navigate to a specified location within a 60 by 60 inch 2D coordinate plane.
Any coordinates within that range can be input using the Zumo 32U4's buttons and will be displayed on the OLED screen.
The robot will then navigate a given coordinate grid when placed facing in the positive Y direction at the origin.

=== Project2 ===
This C Program allows for the Pololu Zumo 32U4 to traverse a given warzone.
Essentially, the program makes use of the Zumo's proximity sensors to detect and turn away from objects that it approaches.
To initialize, the number of objects to avoid must be input using the Zumo's buttons.
The OLED screen of the Zumo will show how close the robot is to an object using a numeric scale from 1-10 and will also count the number of detected objects.
When it successfully avoids the input number of objects, it will do a celebratory spin!
